# WeatherLab
This is my raspberry-pi based weather station project in the Circle C Ranch Area in Austin, TX.

The core is the Raspberry Pi connected to loads of sensors and weather instruments.  This data is posted to a NodeJS based server which processes and stores the data in a non-SQL database in IBM's BlueMix lab.

The front-end UI will be AngularJS based which will present a very simple yet concise web page for the client. 

This is revision 1 so it's pretty basic for now.
